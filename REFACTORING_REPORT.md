## Refactoring Opportunities

### 1. Duplicated GPS Pattern Definitions (DRY Violation)

**Location:** [metadata.py:87-90](src/exif_analyzer/core/metadata.py#L87-L90), [metadata.py:109](src/exif_analyzer/core/metadata.py#L109), [metadata.py:136](src/exif_analyzer/core/metadata.py#L136)

**What:** The GPS/location pattern list `["gps", "latitude", "longitude", "altitude", "location", "geotag", "coordinate", "position"]` is defined three times in the `ImageMetadata` class in methods `has_gps_data()`, `get_privacy_sensitive_keys()`, and `strip_gps_data()`.

**Why Refactor:**
- **DRY Violation:** Same data repeated in three locations increases maintenance burden
- **Inconsistency Risk:** If patterns need updating, all three locations must be changed
- **Single Responsibility:** Pattern definition should be centralized as class-level configuration

**How to Refactor:**
1. Define GPS patterns as a class constant: `GPS_PATTERNS = ["gps", "latitude", "longitude", ...]`
2. Reference this constant in all three methods
3. Consider creating similar constants for device and personal patterns in `get_privacy_sensitive_keys()`

**Tests Covering This Code:**
- `tests/test_jpeg_adapter.py` - Tests GPS detection and stripping
- `tests/test_png_adapter.py` - Tests GPS detection and stripping
- `tests/test_core_engine.py` - Tests metadata operations

**Rating:** 3/5

### 2. Duplicated Adapter Pattern - FileSafetyManager Instantiation

**Location:** [jpeg_adapter.py:24](src/exif_analyzer/adapters/jpeg_adapter.py#L24), [png_adapter.py:24](src/exif_analyzer/adapters/png_adapter.py#L24), [engine.py:28](src/exif_analyzer/core/engine.py#L28)

**What:** Both `JPEGAdapter` and `PNGAdapter` create their own `FileSafetyManager` instances in `__init__`, and the `MetadataEngine` also creates one. This leads to multiple instances when a single shared instance would suffice.

**Why Refactor:**
- **Resource Efficiency:** Multiple managers are unnecessary
- **Dependency Injection:** Adapters should receive the safety manager from the engine
- **SOLID - Dependency Inversion:** Adapters depend on concrete class, not abstraction
- **Testability:** Harder to mock or inject test doubles

**How to Refactor:**
1. Move `FileSafetyManager` instantiation to `MetadataEngine` only
2. Pass safety manager to adapters via constructor: `adapter = JPEGAdapter(safety_manager=self.safety_manager)`
3. Update `BaseMetadataAdapter` to accept optional safety manager parameter
4. Update tests to inject mock safety managers

**Tests Covering This Code:**
- `tests/test_file_safety.py` - Direct safety manager tests (94% coverage)
- `tests/test_jpeg_adapter.py` - Adapter tests with safety operations
- `tests/test_png_adapter.py` - Adapter tests with safety operations

**Rating:** 4/5

---

### 3. Inconsistent Integrity Verification Methods

**Location:** [jpeg_adapter.py:295-385](src/exif_analyzer/adapters/jpeg_adapter.py#L295-L385), [base_adapter.py:152-169](src/exif_analyzer/core/base_adapter.py#L152-L169), [file_safety.py:101-132](src/exif_analyzer/core/file_safety.py#L101-L132)

**What:** Three different integrity verification approaches exist:
- `JPEGAdapter.verify_jpeg_integrity()` - Uses MSE with numpy fallback
- `JPEGAdapter.verify_basic_jpeg_integrity()` - Basic dimensions check
- `BaseMetadataAdapter.verify_pixel_integrity()` - Pixel hash comparison
- `FileSafetyManager.verify_file_integrity()` - File size comparison

**Why Refactor:**
- **KISS Violation:** Overly complex with multiple verification strategies
- **Inconsistent API:** Different adapters may implement different strategies
- **Code Duplication:** Similar validation logic in multiple places
- **Strategy Pattern Missing:** No clear abstraction for verification strategies

**How to Refactor:**
1. Create an `IntegrityVerifier` class with strategy pattern
2. Implement strategies: `PixelHashVerifier`, `JPEGSimilarityVerifier`, `FileBasicVerifier`
3. Let adapters choose appropriate strategy based on format characteristics
4. Consolidate duplicate dimension/mode checks into reusable methods

**Tests Covering This Code:**
- `tests/test_file_safety.py` - File integrity tests
- `tests/test_jpeg_adapter.py` - JPEG-specific integrity tests
- `tests/test_png_adapter.py` - PNG integrity tests (uses pixel_integrity)

**Rating:** 4/5

---

### 4. Massive God Method - CLI `strip` Command (SOLID Violation)

**Location:** [cli/main.py:172-266](src/exif_analyzer/cli/main.py#L172-L266)

**What:** The `strip()` command function is 95 lines long and handles multiple responsibilities: parsing options, reading metadata, preview mode, confirmation prompts, validation, selective stripping logic, output path handling, and result reporting.

**Why Refactor:**
- **Single Responsibility Violation:** One function handles too many concerns
- **High Cyclomatic Complexity:** Multiple nested conditionals make it hard to test and maintain
- **Code Duplication:** Similar logic exists in batch strip command (line 410-443)
- **Testability:** Difficult to unit test individual behaviors

**How to Refactor:**
1. Extract methods: `_preview_strip_operation()`, `_confirm_strip_operation()`, `_perform_selective_strip()`, `_report_strip_results()`
2. Create a `StripOperationHandler` class to encapsulate strip operation logic
3. Move shared logic between single and batch strip to common methods
4. Consider Command pattern for different strip operations (all, GPS, selective)

**Tests Covering This Code:**
- `tests/test_cli_commands.py` - CLI integration tests

**Rating:** 4/5

---

### 5. Duplicated Metadata Iteration Pattern (DRY Violation)

**Location:** Multiple locations across codebase

**What:** The pattern `for block in [metadata.exif, metadata.iptc, metadata.xmp, metadata.custom]` appears at least 8 times:
- [metadata.py:92](src/exif_analyzer/core/metadata.py#L92)
- [metadata.py:119](src/exif_analyzer/core/metadata.py#L119)
- [metadata.py:138](src/exif_analyzer/core/metadata.py#L138)
- [metadata.py:160](src/exif_analyzer/core/metadata.py#L160)
- [cli/main.py:116](src/exif_analyzer/cli/main.py#L116)
- [cli/main.py:208](src/exif_analyzer/cli/main.py#L208)
- [cli/main.py:225](src/exif_analyzer/cli/main.py#L225)
- [cli/main.py:244](src/exif_analyzer/cli/main.py#L244)

**Why Refactor:**
- **DRY Violation:** Repeated iteration logic increases maintenance burden
- **Magic Knowledge:** Callers need to know which blocks exist
- **Error Prone:** Easy to forget a block when adding new ones

**How to Refactor:**
1. Add `ImageMetadata.iter_blocks()` method returning generator: `yield (name, block)`
2. Add `ImageMetadata.get_all_blocks()` returning list of blocks
3. Replace all manual iterations with method calls
4. Makes future additions (e.g., IPTC extensions) easier

**Tests Covering This Code:**
- All metadata-related tests would benefit from this refactoring

**Rating:** 3/5

---

### 6. Inconsistent Error Handling and Logging

**Location:** Throughout adapters and engine

**What:** Error handling approaches are inconsistent:
- Some methods catch Exception and re-raise as custom exception
- Some log then raise, some just raise
- Some use bare `except:` clauses (e.g., [jpeg_adapter.py:104](src/exif_analyzer/adapters/jpeg_adapter.py#L104), [jpeg_adapter.py:258](src/exif_analyzer/adapters/jpeg_adapter.py#L258))
- Some swallow exceptions silently with `pass`

**Why Refactor:**
- **Error Tracking:** Inconsistent logging makes debugging difficult
- **Security:** Bare `except:` can hide critical errors
- **User Experience:** Inconsistent error messages
- **Best Practice Violation:** Bare except catches SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt

**How to Refactor:**
1. Create error handling decorator: `@handle_adapter_errors`
2. Establish error handling patterns by method type (read, write, validate)
3. Replace all bare `except:` with `except Exception as e:`
4. Add structured logging with context (operation, file, adapter)
5. Create error classification: recoverable vs fatal

**Tests Covering This Code:**
- All test files should include error case testing

**Rating:** 3/5

---

### 7. GUI Method Complexity and Responsibilities (SOLID Violation)

**Location:** [gui/main.py](src/exif_analyzer/gui/main.py)

**What:** The `ExifAnalyzerGUI` class has 483 lines and handles multiple responsibilities:
- UI layout creation
- Event handling
- File operations
- Metadata display
- Image preview
- Business logic

**Why Refactor:**
- **Single Responsibility Violation:** UI, business logic, and data management all in one class
- **Tight Coupling:** Hard to test business logic separate from UI
- **Poor Separation of Concerns:** MVC/MVP pattern not followed
- **Hard to Extend:** Adding features requires modifying monolithic class

**How to Refactor:**
1. Separate into Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern:
   - `GUIView`: Pure UI rendering and event routing
   - `MetadataPresenter`: Business logic and state management
   - Model: Already exists (`ImageMetadata`, `MetadataEngine`)
2. Extract formatters: `FilePathFormatter`, `MetadataTreeFormatter`
3. Extract file list management to separate class
4. Extract image preview to separate component

**Tests Covering This Code:**
- No GUI tests currently exist (testing gap)

**Rating:** 4/5

---

### 8. Batch Command Function Duplication

**Location:** [cli/main.py:322-479](src/exif_analyzer/cli/main.py#L322-L479)

**What:** The batch strip command (158 lines) duplicates significant logic from the single-file strip command. The nested `process_file()` function (lines 410-443) replicates logic from the main strip command.

**Why Refactor:**
- **DRY Violation:** Same strip logic in two places
- **Maintenance Burden:** Bug fixes need to be applied twice
- **Inconsistency Risk:** Behavior can diverge between single and batch operations

**How to Refactor:**
1. Extract common strip logic to a helper class: `StripOperationExecutor`
2. Create methods: `execute_strip()`, `execute_gps_strip()`, `execute_selective_strip()`
3. Both CLI commands call the same underlying methods
4. Batch processor just handles parallelization and reporting

**Tests Covering This Code:**
- `tests/test_cli_commands.py` - Batch operation tests

**Rating:** 4/5

---

### 9. Magic Numbers and String Literals (Configuration Violation)

**Location:** Throughout codebase

**What:** Magic numbers and hardcoded values scattered throughout:
- Preview size: `(300, 300)` in GUI ([gui/main.py:183](src/exif_analyzer/gui/main.py#L183))
- MSE threshold: `2.0` in JPEG adapter ([jpeg_adapter.py:335](src/exif_analyzer/adapters/jpeg_adapter.py#L335))
- Size ratio: `0.1` in file safety ([file_safety.py:126](src/exif_analyzer/core/file_safety.py#L126))
- Backup keep count: `5` ([file_safety.py:206](src/exif_analyzer/core/file_safety.py#L206))
- String truncation: `100`, `97`, `50` characters in multiple places
- File chunk size: `4096` in hashing

**Why Refactor:**
- **Maintainability:** Hard to find and update related constants
- **Configuration:** These should be configurable by users
- **Magic Values:** No context for why specific values were chosen
- **YAGNI Violation:** Config system exists but underutilized

**How to Refactor:**
1. Move all magic numbers to configuration with descriptive keys
2. Add constants module for truly constant values
3. Document rationale for threshold values
4. Make UI dimensions, thresholds, and limits configurable

**Tests Covering This Code:**
- Configuration tests should verify defaults

**Rating:** 2/5

### 10. Repetitive Block Name Tuples

**Location:** [cli/main.py:116-117](src/exif_analyzer/cli/main.py#L116-L117), [cli/main.py:138-139](src/exif_analyzer/cli/main.py#L138-L139), [gui/main.py:244-248](src/exif_analyzer/gui/main.py#L244-L248)

**What:** The tuple `[("EXIF", metadata.exif), ("IPTC", metadata.iptc), ("XMP", metadata.xmp), ("Custom", metadata.custom)]` is repeated in multiple locations with slight variations.

**Why Refactor:**
- **DRY Violation:** Same data structure created repeatedly
- **Fragility:** Easy to misspell or forget a block
- **Related to Issue #5:** Part of broader metadata iteration problem

**How to Refactor:**
1. Add `ImageMetadata.iter_named_blocks()` method
2. Returns consistent tuples of (display_name, block)
3. Single source of truth for block names and order

**Tests Covering This Code:**
- Metadata iteration tests

**Rating:** 2/5

---

### 11. Format Map Duplication in Engine

**Location:** [engine.py:82-92](src/exif_analyzer/core/engine.py#L82-L92)

**What:** The `get_adapter()` method contains a hardcoded MIME type to format mapping dictionary that duplicates knowledge of supported formats already present in adapters.

**Why Refactor:**
- **DRY Violation:** Format information duplicated between adapters and engine
- **Maintainability:** Adding new format requires updating multiple locations
- **Open/Closed Principle Violation:** Engine needs modification for new formats

**How to Refactor:**
1. Add `get_mime_types()` method to `BaseMetadataAdapter`
2. Build MIME type map dynamically from registered adapters
3. Alternatively, use `mimetypes` module exclusively without hardcoded map

**Tests Covering This Code:**
- `tests/test_core_engine.py` - Format detection tests

**Rating:** 2/5

---
### 12. Config Deep Copy Issue

**Location:** [config.py:57](src/exif_analyzer/core/config.py#L57)

**What:** `self._config = self.DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()` performs shallow copy of nested dictionary. Modifications to nested dicts will affect DEFAULT_CONFIG.

**Why Refactor:**
- **Bug Risk:** Mutating nested config values can corrupt defaults
- **Side Effects:** Multiple instances share nested dict references
- **Best Practice:** Use `deepcopy` for nested structures

**How to Refactor:**
1. Import `copy.deepcopy`
2. Change to `self._config = copy.deepcopy(self.DEFAULT_CONFIG)`
3. Add test to verify config isolation

**Tests:** Config tests should verify isolation
**Rating:** 3/5

---

### 13. Context Manager Not Used Consistently

**Location:** [engine.py:249-250](src/exif_analyzer/core/engine.py#L249-L250), [engine.py:280-281](src/exif_analyzer/core/engine.py#L280-L281)

**What:** File read operation in `restore_metadata()` reads entire file into memory.

**Why Refactor:**
- **Resource Leaks:** Files may not close properly on exceptions
- **Best Practice:** Always use context managers
- **Memory:** Loading entire file before parsing

**How to Refactor:**
1. Audit all file operations
2. Ensure all use `with` statements
3. Consider streaming for large files

**Tests:** Resource leak tests (currently missing)
**Rating:** 2/5

---

### 14. Missing Type Hints

**Location:** Multiple locations (progress.py, config.py:92-100, GUI handlers)

**What:** Many functions lack type hints

**Why Refactor:**
- **Type Safety:** Harder to catch errors at dev time
- **Documentation:** Type hints serve as inline docs
- **IDE Support:** Reduced autocomplete
- **Consistency:** Some modules typed, others not

**How to Refactor:**
1. Add type hints to all public methods
2. Use `mypy` in strict mode
3. Add type checking to CI

**Tests:** Type checking would catch many issues
**Rating:** 2/5

---

### 15. Test Coverage Gaps

**Location:** Test suite overall (67% coverage)

**What:** Significant testing gaps:
- No GUI tests
- No config validation tests
- Limited CLI error case tests
- Missing batch operation edge cases
- No performance tests

**Why Refactor:**
- **Quality:** Untested code likely has bugs
- **Regression Risk:** Refactoring without tests dangerous
- **Confidence:** Low coverage reduces change confidence

**How to Refactor:**
1. Achieve 85%+ coverage for critical paths
2. Add property-based tests
3. Add CLI integration tests
4. Mock GUI for testing
5. Add performance benchmarks

**Tests:** This IS the issue - insufficient tests
**Rating:** 3/5
